# Welcome to _MBGA_ (Make BASIC Great Again)!
This repository of projects is dedicated to **WinRT** (Windows Runtime) and using it to enhance applications written in **VB6/VBA** as well as their 64bit successor **twinBASIC**. WinRT is Microsoft’s modern application framework introduced with Windows 8 that provides a language-independent way to build Windows apps. Its primary benefits are cross-language support, modern security, simplified app deployment, and access to rich Windows APIs.
## 🔎 What is WinRT?
- **Definition:** WinRT is not a “runtime” in the traditional sense but an application binary interface (ABI) built on COM (Component Object Model). It is exactly this COM foundation that makes it an excellent candidate for integration with all BASIC flavors which are the perfect COM consumers!
- **Purpose:** It serves as the foundation for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps and modern Windows APIs. This includes modernizing old applications with rich GUIs using XAML Islands.
- **Languages Supported:** Developers can use C++ (via C++/WinRT or C++/CX), C#, VB.NET, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and even Rust to access WinRT APIs. Here we are focusing on adding **VB6/VBA** and **twinBASIC** to this list of programming languages that can consume WinRT APIs.
## 🌟 Primary Benefits of WinRT
- **Cross-Language Interoperability**  
WinRT APIs are designed to be consumed by multiple programming languages seamlessly. This means developers can choose their preferred language without losing access to Windows features.
- **Unified API Surface**  
WinRT provides a consistent API model across desktop, tablet, and phone, enabling developers to build cross-device apps more easily.
- **Asynchronous Programming Support**  
Many WinRT APIs are designed to be asynchronous by default, improving responsiveness in modern apps (e.g., UI remains smooth while background tasks run).
- **Modern UI Integration**  
WinRT was built to support Metro-style (later UWP) apps, which are touch-friendly, responsive, and aligned with modern design paradigms.
## 🚀 Potential Benefits of Enhancing BASIC applications with WinRT Classes
- **Access to Modern Windows APIs**  
Many BASIC applications are stuck in the late 90s ecosystem (Win32, COM, ActiveX). By consuming WinRT classes, we can breathe new life into these old apps by tapping into modern Windows features like notifications, sensors, geolocation, Bluetooth, and UWP-style UI components.
- **Cross-Language Interoperability**  
Since WinRT is language-agnostic, BASIC applications could interoperate more cleanly with apps written in C#, C++, or JavaScript. This would allow BASIC developers to integrate with newer systems without rewriting their codebase.
- **Asynchronous Programming Support**  
WinRT APIs are designed with async patterns. VB6/VBA, which traditionally struggled with threading, could leverage async WinRT calls to keep UIs responsive without complex hacks.
- **Future-Proofing Legacy Code**  
Many enterprises still run VB6 apps. Wrapping those apps with WinRT components would allow them to extend functionality without a full rewrite, bridging legacy systems with modern Windows.
